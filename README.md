Collaboration: It allows project maintainers and other contributors to discuss the problem, agree on solutions, or give feedback.

Transparency: Issues allow everyone to see whatâ€™s going on, making it easy for others to contribute in a coordinated way.

3. What Pull Requests (PR) Do

Code review: Project maintainers or collaborators review your changes to make sure they fit the project's goals, style, and functionality.
